# CAS Interpreter

This code is legacy, unsupported code, so use at your own risk. There are plenty of ways to crash the program. 

## About this program

CoolAwesomeScript (CAS) is a custom scripting language built off of the Java compiler. It is fairly limited in its scope, allowing basic variable creation, math operations, and file creation. The CAS interpreter does allow running presaved scripts (stored in .cas files) if you would like to try writing scripts in Notepad or Notepad++ instead. Attached is a sample script. The .jar file attached is the interpreter file, which is designed to be run at the command line. Run ```java -jar prototype_cli.jar ``` in the terminal to see it work. 

## Purpose

This program was developed as an independent study during my senior year of high school (2020). In order to get a deeper understanding of data types, data structures, and algorithms, I decided to try to build my own programming language to try to learn hands-on how interpreters work. Were I to do this all over again, I would try to build an interpreter closer to others, using tokenization and advanced data structures as opposed to more simple structures. Overall, it's not a bad attempt for a high schooler, and could be rebuilt in a more efficient manner if someone wanted to dedicate hours of their life to it. 

## ⚠️ **Warning:** Since this is unsupported code developed by a high-schooler, some variable names may be confusing. While I have worked to add comments, many have been added retroactively and they do not accurately describe what is happening.
