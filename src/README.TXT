This folder contains all the source code for the compiled .jar. Some of the code may not be clear, as many comments were retroactively added. This project was initially created for a high school project in 2020, and the past version of myself neglected to contain any meaningul comments. I've done my best to rename variables and include comments for clarity. The general flow of the .jar is Main.java > Create.java > Variable classes.
